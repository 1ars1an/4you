### personal

##### what i'm tryna gain

- strengthen react skills
- strengthen grid skills
- work with tailwindcss
- learn/explore next.js
- learn/explore vercel deployment

##### working area

- what pages do i need?
- how do i decide on the state?

ok i decided on these with some thought that i did in my head, probably not a good idea. will try to be more intentional with it for further decisions.

- current shimmer animation adds a layer for each task completed. do i continue with this or just have 1 layer that runs when all tasks completed?
